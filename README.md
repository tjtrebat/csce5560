Group Members: Thomas Trebat, Timmy Akindunni, Geary Erua, Adesina Tijani, Yash Chulki

Description: This is a Secure E-Commerce Website that includes pages such as Product Categories, Products, Shopping Cart, Checkout, Confirmation, Login, and Registration. The project was mostly done in the Virtual Machine with the use of the MySQL database and the PHP programming language with the use of Wordpress to host our website and manage our pages.

Project Layout: As mentioned above in the description, the project has been implemented through the use of several frameworks. The frameworks are PHP 7.4.3, WordPress 6.1.1, phpMyAdmin 7.9.5, and MySQL 8.0.32. The environment we used was through Ubuntu in the virtual machine, and the plugins used for the implementation of the website is Insert PHP Code Snippet 1.3.3. The vulnerabilities remediated for testing in this project are SQL injection, Cross-Site Scripting(XSS), and Cross-Site Request Forgery(CSRF).

Setup Instructions: 

For the setup, you will have to have PHP installed on your computer system. For the PHP installation, it honestly depends on the operating system of your computer. 

For example, Apple and Linux users often have PHP and Apache already installed on their systems, whereas for Windows, you might have to personally install it.

For installation in Windows, there are variety of ways:

1. Use a popular application that has PHP, Apache, and MySQL such as XAMPP or WampServer
2. Use a virtual machine e.g. Linux
3. Install PHP locally on your computer

From there, you would be able to run the PHP files with no problem.
